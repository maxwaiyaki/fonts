# Fonts Files

This project contains the binary font files that fascinate me.

The top level directories indicate the license of all files found within them.
Subdirectories are named according to the family name of the fonts within.


## Bug reports and improvement requests

If you find a problem with a font file or have a request for future development of a font project, please [create a new issue in this project's issue tracker](https://github.com/maxwaiyaki/fonts/issues).


## Licensing

It is important to always read the license for every font that you use.
Each font family directory contains the appropriate license file for the fonts in that directory.
The fonts files themselves also contain licensing and authorship metadata.
